## Coffee Sales Analysis

Analyzed coffee sales data using SQL for data manipulation and insights with aggregate and window functions. Visualized the data in Power BI using DAX for month-to-date sales and month-on-month changes, featuring interactive heatmaps and tooltips.

## SQL Analysis

In this project, I used SQL to analyze coffee sales data by leveraging aggregate functions to calculate total sales and average unit prices. Window functions were employed to compute running totals and moving averages, providing deeper insights into sales trends over time. Data manipulation techniques were applied to clean and prepare the dataset, enabling accurate and meaningful analysis.

## Power BI Visualization
Power BI was utilized to visualize the coffee sales data. DAX functions were used to calculate month-to-date (MTD) sales and month-on-month (MoM) changes. Interactive heatmaps and tooltips were incorporated into the visuals to enhance data presentation and user experience, allowing for easy identification of sales patterns and trends across different products and locations.
